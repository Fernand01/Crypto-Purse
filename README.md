Abstract:

A payment processing application that extends from your browser.  From this purse you can exchange payment for access to sites.  
What makes this different is the focus on micro payments.  $.0000000000000000001 (to the 20th decimal point) - $5.00 space utilizing cryptocurrency and blockchain technology
The long term play is that eventually we will all pay for content, the misconception is that we will pay large ammounts like $15 to post a picture on social media
In fact you will pay but in micro payments to recognize SoWs of original content.  Based on your organicness and relevance you will be subject to more of the pool of payments for your site.
You will also generate revenue allowing viewers to see your site ad free if they choose, much like a HUlu upgraded account so you don't have to view commercials.
